## Failed login rate limit

If your Cloud Foundry account makes too many failed login attempts within a short period of time, your account will be locked for security reasons. While the account is locked, even the correct login details will not work. 

Wait 5 minutes without trying to log in for the lock to expire. 

Make sure that no automated services (such as Jenkins) are trying to log in using your account during this time.
